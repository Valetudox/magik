description: Write and execute code using E2B SDK for sandbox operations
---

## Workflow

1. Use the `sandbox` skill to learn how to use the E2B SDK
2. Based on the user's request, write TypeScript code that uses the E2B SDK
3. The code should follow the patterns from the sandbox skill guide:
   - Create sandbox with `Sandbox.create()`
   - Execute code with `sandbox.runCode()`
   - Handle files with `sandbox.files.write()` and `sandbox.files.read()`
   - Clean up with `sandbox.kill()` in finally block
4. Execute the code and report results
