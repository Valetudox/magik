INC-463,2025-11-04T10:20:27Z,Symptoms: One segmentation cluster slowed down due to activity from customer ace and others.,CL + SeSe,M,H,P2
INC-432,2025-10-17T06:15:54Z,'templawebster' overloaded the Segmentation Service causing email and automation program processing delays for all customers and causing potentially false email campaign status displays (aborted) for the impacted campaigns,CL + SeSe,M,H,P2
INC-421,2025-10-09T00:34:30Z,Increased web load on suite27 due to a surge in segmentation requests from one customer.,SeSe,-,H,P2
INC-395,2025-09-23T09:55:24Z,Contact lists still in use on wait nodes were deleted from automation programs causing contacts to be removed from those programs.,CL,H,-,P2
INC-390,2025-09-17T07:31:36Z,A sudden and extreme surge in API requests to the segmentation-service overloaded the suite30 webservers resulting in partial API call blocking.,CL + SeSe,H,H,P2
INC-333,2025-07-18T11:30:50Z,some routing changes deployed for SeSe resulted in double consumption of request bodies leading to internal server errors.,SeSe,-,H,P2
INC-329,2025-07-11T08:14:00Z,Because of high load coming from Limango (~2.5 million segment requests in 1 hour) through Interactions there was a slowdown in Interactions because of Segmentation.,SeSe,-,H,P2
INC-237,2025-02-20T15:47:16Z,High db load transactional segmentation was affected on all environments (normally 5s went up to 5 minutes),SeSe,-,M,P2
INC-233,2025-02-10T11:31:00Z,Contactlist listing endpoint not working,CL,H,-,P2
INC-223,2025-01-12T20:27:27Z,Segmentation service (SeSe) has unusually big numbers of redis keys. SeSe cluster breakdown.,SeSe,-,H,P2
INC-184,2024-10-15T15:59:50Z,Delays in segment runs (The issue is most likely related to the tool used for clustering in the segmentation service),SeSe,-,H,P2
INC-178,2024-09-24T11:19:51Z,Suite 5 API calls are limited due to too many connections in the main database. SeSe was down so transactional segment executions were delayed during this time.,SeSe,-,M,P2
INC-170,2024-09-05T10:18:06Z,s5 API limited The issue was triggered by a large number of segmentation requests that flooded the s5 database with connections. (problematic endpoint: look up a contact in a segment),SeSe,-,M,P2
INC-151,2024-07-22T00:12:27Z,suite10 down (Found a program that us a userlist with 2million entries),CL?,L,-,P1
INC-141,2024-07-06T18:48:24Z,Transactional segment requests are slower than usual (Root cause: This happened because we currently have 150000 queue items in the segmentation service.),SeSe,-,H,P2
INC-134,2024-06-26T03:14:13Z,Slowdown in segmentation happened because a customer accidentally sent a large number of requests causing a DDoS-like effect.,SeSe,-,H,P2
INC-131,2024-06-18T16:26:02Z,Throughput degradation in Segmentation Akka cluster has got into an inconsistent state due to a not standard restart,SeSe,-,H,P2
